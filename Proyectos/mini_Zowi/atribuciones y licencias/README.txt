# Summary

Who is Otto DIY?
===============
An interactive robot that anyone can make!
Otto walks, dances, makes sounds and avoids obstacles 
https://www.youtube.com/ottodiy
Is completely open source, Arduino compatible and 3D printable

Gather all the off the shelf parts that you'll need for this assembly.
If you don't have or is difficult to get the part you can just 

buy our full kits!
=======
Visit http://www.ottodiy.com/
NO SOLDERING REQUIRED!

List of parts:
===============
1. Arduino Nano;
2. Arduino Nano Shield I/O Extension Board Expansion XD-212
3. Mini usb cable.
4. HC-SR04 Ultrasound sensor.
5. Mini servo SG90 9g x4 (each one should come with 2 pointed screws and one small screw also arm keys to attach legs and feet).
6. 5V Buzzer.
7. Female to Female breadboard connectors cable 10cm x6.
8. 4 AA Battery case
9. 1.5V AA batteries x4.
10. Phillips screwdriver. (important magnetized)
11. Micro square Switch 8x8mm

And then you only need to 3D print 6 parts in total:
12. 3D printed head.
13. 3D printed body.
14. 3D printed leg x2.
15. 3D printed foot x2

update feet and legs latest version use the small plastic arm that comes with the servo motor SG90 to attach them.

Use the customizer to can change easily the size and parameters as you desire.

Use Instruction Manual for assembly instructions and Arduino or mblock or Adruinoblocks for coding, simple an easy graphical programming.

Programming setup with Arduino:
==================
1. Download & Install Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/

2. Copy all libraries to C:\Users\user\Documents\Arduino\libraries (or wherever your library folder is installed): 

3. Finally open OttoDIY_smooth_criminal.ino code & upload to your Arduino Nano for dancing Otto mode.

4. Try OttoDIY_avoid.ino for obstacle avoidance

For battery power make sure to supply at least 6V and a maximum of 12V in the Vin input
suggested to try first and only program using the Mini USB cable to power your circuit from your computer or a USB socket.

If you want to add Bluetooth control and program with an APP or even your computer remotely try Otto DIY+ https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2398231

# Print Settings

Printer: FlashForge Finder
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.15mm
Infill: 20%

Notes: 
Recommended to use a FDM 3D printer with PLA material.

You can print individually piece by piece to match the colors of the original design or optionally print all at the same time in an area of 14cm x 14cm.

# Post-Printing

## Legs and Foot fitting

For almost all 3d printers is recommendable use the new version .stl files to print, then you just use the plastic arm of the servo motors with some glue to assemble them together.

# How I Designed This

## Designed using 123D Design (now thinkercad!)

Otto was inspired by another robot BoB the BiPed and programmed using code from Zowi.
CC-BY-SA

Otto's differences are in the assembled size (11cm x 7cm x12cm), cleaner integration of components and expressions. Using off the shelf and 3D printed parts, simple electronics connections (almost no welding required), and basic coding skills, you will be able to build your own cute Otto friend in as little as two hours!

Otto is designed using Autodesk 123D Design software (now thinkercad) you can modify it for customization or further improvements!
